## 🎓 About Me

I'm a seasoned engineering leader recognized as "the best performance marketing technologist in the space" by executive leadership. With a unique blend of technical depth and marketing technology expertise, I drive measurable business impact through strategic infrastructure decisions and pioneering use of generative AI tools for rapid prototyping, automation, and code quality.

While many leaders talk about AI, I use it daily to ship production code. My GitHub commits from 2025 show consistent AI-assisted development across Python automation, infrastructure tooling, and complex problem-solving. I understand AI's capabilities and limitations from hands-on experience, not theory.
