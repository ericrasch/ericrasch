## 🎓 About Me

I'm a seasoned engineering leader recognized as "the best performance marketing technologist in the space" by executive leadership. With a unique blend of technical depth and marketing technology expertise, I drive measurable business impact through strategic infrastructure decisions and pioneering use of generative AI tools for rapid prototyping, automation, and code quality.

While many leaders talk about AI, I use it daily to ship production code. Since 2023, I've leveraged ChatGPT, Claude, and Claude Code to achieve 3x development velocity, building production automation in days instead of weeks. My GitHub commits from 2025 show consistent AI-assisted development across Python automation, infrastructure tooling, and complex problem-solving. I understand AI's capabilities and limitations from hands-on experience, not theory.
